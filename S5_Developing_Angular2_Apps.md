# Developing Angular2 Apps
with Venkat Subramaniam
___

Can code Angular in ES6 (not TypeScript).  Just have to configure package manager such as webpack.

Code will all be compiled down to source JavaScript by compiler such as Babel.

This session was similar to S1, except with use of ES6 instead of TypeScript.  Would recommend using TypeScript based on available tooling.
